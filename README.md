# Whiteboard-Marker-Tracker-ESP8266

A device which tracks the position of a whiteboard marker through an IMU attached to the marker, and displays the trace as an SVG in a web browser via a WiFi module.

Initial processing of the IMU data was done on an Arduino Pro Mini which was connected to the WiFi module over UART. The WiFi module was an ESP8266 which I programmed through the Arduino IDE.
